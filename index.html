  <h1>My Journey how I eventually became a QA tester</h1>

  <p>
    This project serves as a personal summary of what I studied before getting my first job in IT.
    It's not a portfolio or a showcase of HTML/CSS skills — just a way to track and share my learning path.
    Hopefully, it can serve as motivation for others starting out in testing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Where it all begun</h2>

  <h3>Khan Academy</h3>
  <p>
    I started by learning the basics of HTML and CSS through Khan Academy. Understanding these basics has helped me
    even as a tester, especially when analyzing websites or working with DevTools.
    <br />

  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>NaučmeIT</h3>
  <p>
    This Czech platform helped me go deeper into QA topics. It also recommended Khan Academy at the beginning.
    <br />
    Both sites offer free access to content about HTML, CSS, DevTools, and more.

  <h3>Radek Kitner – 3-Month Course: "How to Become a Tester"</h3>
  <p>
    I joined a 3-month QA course led by Radek Kitner. The course was very practical, not just theory.
  </p>
  <h4>Topics I Learned:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating test cases</li>
    <li>Writing in TestRail</li>
    <li>Bug reporting in Jira</li>
    <li>Basic SQL commands</li>
    <li>SCRUM methodology</li>
    <li>Types of testing</li>
    <li>API testing in Postman</li>
    <li>Analyzing network traffic using Wireshark</li>
    <li>Using browser DevTools</li>
  </ul>
    <br>

  <h3>GEN Academy (Avast) – ISTQB Prep Course</h3>
  <p>
    I had the opportunity to attend an ISTQB CTFL prep course, which I completed with the final exam.
  </p>
  <h4>Topics I Learned:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Fundamentals of Testing</li>
    <li>Testing Throughout the SDLC</li>
    <li>Static Testing</li>
    <li>Test Techniques</li>
    <li>Test Management</li>
    <li>Tool Support</li>
    <li>Practical experience with black-box, static, and exploratory testing</li>
  </ul>
    <br>

  <h3>Python Basics</h3>
  <p>
    During the ISTQB course, I also learned Python with Jaroslav Kafka. He introduced basic data types and explained Git in more depth.
    <br />
    Although Python wasn’t ideal for web testing, it helped me understand programming fundamentals.
    <br />
    Today, I mostly use JavaScript and TypeScript, but the experience with Python made code easier to read and understand.
  </p>

  <h3>Test Automation – Online Course</h3>
  <p>
    I took an automation course that covered:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Theoretical background of automation</li>
    <li>Basic use of PyCharm</li>
    <li>Basics of Robot Framework</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the course was a bit outdated and didn’t add much value.
  </p>
    <br>

  <h2>My First Job in IT</h2>
  <p>
    In January 2024, I landed my first IT job as a QA Engineer (software tester).
    <br />
    The beginning was tough, but it helped me understand how things really work in a company.
    <br />
    Cheers to all junior testers — stay consistent, work on your own projects, explore, and don’t stop applying!
    <br />
    Most importantly: don't push too hard. The goal is to enjoy what you do.
    <br />
    Good luck everybody! Daniel #2025
