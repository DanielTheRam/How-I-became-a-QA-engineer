# My Tester Journey

This is a personal HTML page where I document my path from self-study to landing my first QA job.  
It includes the resources I used, the courses I took, and the lessons I learned along the way.

I created this to track my own growth â€” and maybe inspire others who are on a similar journey.

The project is fully static (HTML + CSS), with no JavaScript or backend logic.  
For code samples and testing projects, see my other repositories. This one serves only as a personal diary.
